# geoffrey

*geoffrey* is a hackable personal assistant. He is like *Siri* or *Google Now* for Nerds. Be nice to him!

He uses [wit.ai](https://wit.ai) to interpret your input and the processes it using [small plugins](https://github.com/derhuerst/.geoffrey). He listens for HTTP requests by the [client](https://github.com/derhuerst/geoffrey-client).

You could install *geoffrey* on your *Raspberry Pi* and connect a client running on your computer.

He uses [wit.ai](https://wit.ai) to interpret your HTTP input and the processes it using [small plugins](https://github.com/derhuerst/.geoffrey). *geoffrey* is written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) and published under the [MIT license](./blob/master/LICENSE.md).

You could install *geoffrey* on your *Raspberry Pi* and connect a client running on your computer.

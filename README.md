# geoffrey

***geoffrey* is a hackable personal assistant**, similar to *[Siri](https://www.apple.com/de/ios/siri/)* or *[Google Now](http://www.google.com/landing/now/)*, but for Nerds. He uses [wit.ai](https://wit.ai) to **interpret your input and processes it using [small plugins](https://github.com/derhuerst/.geoffrey)**. *geoffrey* is written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) and published under the [MIT license](./blob/master/LICENSE.md).

***geoffrey* is only a server. To use him conveniently, you need to an [adapter](./blob/master/docs/adapters.md) and a [client](./blob/master/docs/clients.md).** You could also install *geoffrey* (the server) on a small server-like machine in your house – for example on a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) – and run the client on your local computer.
